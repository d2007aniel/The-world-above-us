    <p><i> 
<p>In the realm where dreams ignite</p>
 <p>A lad of seventeen, his future in sight</p>
<p>From academic halls, he steps anew</p>
<p>To the boycode's call, ambitions grew</p>

<p>To the stars, he reached on high</p>
<p>Defying odds, beneath the sky</p>
<p>At seventeen, a coding dream</p>
<p>In the universe of bits, he found his scheme</p>

<p>Through challenges of life's grand lore</p>
<p>He faced the trials, the world explored</p>
<p>In the coding cosmos, he found his way</p>
<p>A journey unfolding, night and day</p>

<p>Stars whispered secrets in the code</p>
<p>Binary tales, on a path he strode</p>
<p>>With every keystroke, a comet's trail</p>
<p>In the coding cosmos, where dreams set sail</p>

 <p>Amidst the syntax, and lessons learned</p>
 <p>He embraced the spice, for life's journey turned.</p>
<p>In the lines of code, and friendships found</p>
<p>A vibrant world where joy resounds</p>

<p>At seventeen, he dared to dream</p>
<p>To the stars, his spirit did gleam</p>
<p>No challenge too vast, no task too grand</p>
<p>He shaped his destiny with coding's hand</p>

<p>Through the galaxy of syntax and lines</p>
<p>He found a language, where brilliance shines</p>
<p>To the stars, he reached with grace</p>
<p>A cosmic dance, a coding embrace</p>

<p>Through the binary, a symphony played</p>
<p>In the boycode cosmos, dreams conveyed</p>
<p>Defying odds, he etched his name</p>
<p>In the constellations of coding fame</p>

<p>Oh, young dreamer, bound for the sky</p>
<p>In the coding cosmos, you learned to fly</p>
<p>To the stars, you've drawn near</p>
<p>A seventeen-year journey, crystal clear</p>

<p>With the spice of life, and dreams ablaze</p>
<p>In the coding cosmos, navigating the maze</p>
<p>A tapestry woven with laughter and strife</p>
 <p>A vibrant lad, embracing life</p>
